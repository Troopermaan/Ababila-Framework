# Ababila Framework ðŸ˜ƒ
Pretty generic game framework. Works as a module loader and a way to organize your code.
I will add more modules occasionally.

# Installation
Download the latest release, and import to roblox studio.  
Keep in mind, the releases have only the essential modules pre installed (Cleaner, FastSignal).  
You will have to obtain any new modules I add through here, and install them along with their used modules yourself.  

# License
You can use this however you want, just don't be a skid and say you made shit that you didn't make. :)
Also, not all modules here belong to me. I will specify with a comment at the top if it isn't mine.
